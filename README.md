### Knowledge Representation and Insight Generation from Structured Datasets



Project Description
This project aims to develop an AI-based solution to process, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from the [Adult Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult). The key objectives are to preprocess the data, represent the knowledge effectively, and identify patterns to support decision-making processes.

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and removing duplicate records.
2. **Data Transformation:** Normalizing numerical features and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features and selecting relevant ones.
4. **Data Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training and test sets for model evaluation.

**Libraries Used:**
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- Scipy: For statistical functions.

### Ensuring Scalability

To handle large datasets, we use PySpark for efficient and scalable data processing.
